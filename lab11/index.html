					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p id="Reflection">We worked together as partners for this lab. We gave advice to each other on what to do for each section of code, and cooperated on research to find the correct code for the intended result.
						We coorporated espetially around the toggleClass code, since we were totally confused at first on what we were suppossed to be doing.
