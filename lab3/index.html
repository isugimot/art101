					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>A challenge I had was on having partners, and I couldn't get people teaming up with me.</p>
					<p>The coding itself for this assignment was simple, and wasn't a problem</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I really didn't have any problems, except on partners</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I probably should go find partners mutch faster.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the index.html that I edited. I already had one given by class, so I used it as an template on working.</p>
