			<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We worked together and experimented with DOM modification and manipluation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The first problem we had was communication issues due to my internet, which was relatively minor since we managed to solve it quickly.
						The main problem we had in this lab was with researching and learning about new DOM manipulation methods, and it cost us a large amount of time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We worked together as partners for this lab. We gave advice to each other on what to do for each section of code, and cooperated on research to find the correct code for the intended result.</p>
