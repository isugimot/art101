					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We worked on JSON and APIs, and made codes inplementing them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2 >Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I had was on the CORS extension on my google chrome because I have an odd bug in which the google chrome browser don't allow me to download anything. 
						I managed to get over the problem by downloading the file for the extention from firefox and then sending that extention file to my chrome browser.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I believe we managed to work through the lab successfully, managing to get an working code with expected result.
