            <h1>Hello World!</h1>

            <p>I am working with Eri Foulds for this lab. We're cooperating well, and are managing to work through the lab.
                 Iâ€™m working on the index.html, and Eri is working on the CSS file.</p>
			<p>I think I'm doing fine in my area, at least for now. I already have some experience in coding, 
                so this seems pretty easy. It reminds me of Python, since we just need to follow a specific 
                format of code to make things work.
