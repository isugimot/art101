            <h1>Hello World!</h1>

            <p>I currently do not have an partner, and I'm honestly confused with how the partner matching system works. 
                I sent out the Google Form, but there still isn't any responce. I'm mostly open on Monday, Wednsday, and on Weekends.</p>
			<p>I think I'm doing fine with myself, at least for now. I already have some experience on coding, so this seems pretty easy.
                It remindes me of Python, since we just need to follow a specific format of code to make things work.
            </p>

            <p>I'm not sure if this is how it is suppossed to be like, but I alrady have an set of index and css file.</p>
            <p>Am I suppossed to delete these?</p>
